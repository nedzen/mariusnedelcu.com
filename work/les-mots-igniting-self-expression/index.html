Working closely with the founders we shaped the story of a writing school that didn’t yet exist. Next, we launched a website to present the concept and to enquire visitors about their interest in a project as such. For this purpose, I produced a number of illustrations to complement the story and set the ambient. These were used on the website and in a strategic PDF presentation of the project.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>We shortly discovered that many people loved the concept and were eager to engage. Their motivations were varied and knowing about them helped further inform the strategy and the design.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure class="one">&#x000A;    <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/lesmots_img_1.jpg" alt="Setkeeper Logo - Geometry">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>The aesthetic of the logo was mainly inspired by the name: LES MOTS. Its commonness had to be played to its advantage and I found appropriate to have it written in uppercase such that it further emphasizes the importance of words as pillars of human communication. The space between the letters it is meant to evoke openness, one of the core values of the school. The logotype also has a subtle resemblance with the typographic style used in chapter titles of Victorian age books; hopefully marking the beginning of a new chapter in the life of anyone who takes on writing.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>The challenge was eventually met. The resulting identity looks modern, elegant and has great versatility standing out in large and small sizes.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure>&#x000A;    <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/logo_lesmots.jpg" alt="Setkeeper Logo - Geometry">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3 id="poster">Poster</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Creative direction</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure class="one">&#x000A;    <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/poster1.jpg" alt="Les Mots Poster">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure class="one">&#x000A;  <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/poster2.jpg" alt="Les Mots Poster">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<h3 id="the-online-platform">The online platform</h3>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>Before LES MOTS opened its doors it was essential to create a website that would reflect the unique nature of the school and let visitors discover and inscribe on courses.</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>To achieve that I have designed a general coherent online experience by addressing these 3 challenges:</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<p>To effectively communicate the concept along with the people involved and their roles.&#x000A;To present the commercial offer in a structured manner so that visitors quickly discover the courses that interest them.&#x000A;To give a hint at the benefits of joining LES MOTS by featuring regular events and content produced by enrolled students in courses</p>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure>&#x000A;    <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/web_home.jpg" alt="Setkeeper Logo - Geometry">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<figure>&#x000A;  <img src="/images/work/les-mots-igniting-self-expression/web_course.jpg" alt="Setkeeper Logo - Geometry">&#x000A;</figure>&#x000A;&#x000A;<ul class="project-info">&#x000A;  <li><a href="http://www.lesmots.co">lesmots.co</a></li>&#x000A;</ul>&#x000A;&#x000A;<div class="client">&#x000A;  <blockquote class="blockquote">&#x000A;    I met Marius at NUMA when I started working on Les Mots early 2016. I immediately thought of Marius to realize the first visual and graphic elements of our project (the first version of the site, a PDF presentation of the project that allowed us to engage key players: investors and partners). Marius immediately accepted, and worked a lot, voluntarily, before we can pay him. I&rsquo;ll never forget that. Marius has incredible qualities in terms of creativity, he is very fine and innovative in his vision of design, and his illustrations have seduced me a lot. He is an authentic artist-designer, exactly what I was looking for because I believe in the alliance of talents, and of images and words. I was looking for a sensitive person with a real artistic identity. Marius was a force of proposal and our exchanges also nourished, in an exciting round trip, my own vision of the project. Les Mots could not exist if Marius had not been there.&#x000A;    <cite>&#x000A;      <img src="/images/elise.jpeg">&#x000A;      <div>&#x000A;        <strong> Elise Nebout </strong>&#x000A;        <span> CEO and co-founder LES Mots </span>&#x000A;      </div>&#x000A;    </cite>&#x000A;  </blockquote>&#x000A;  <div class="avatar"><img src="/images/elise.jpeg"></div>&#x000A;</div></div></div></div><div class="wrap" id="page-nav"><div class="row"><div class="col-2"></div><div class="col-6"><div class="gonext"><a href="/work/gorgias-long-term-design-partners/"><span>Next</span><h2>Long-term design partners&nbsp; →</h2></a></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="wrap"><div class="row"><div class="col-3"><span class="copy">&copy; mariusnedelcu.com</span></div><div class="col-5"><ul class="links nav-list"><li><a target="_blank" href="https://ello.co/mariusnedelcu">ello</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nedzen">twitter</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mariusnedelcu">facebook</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mariusnedelcu/">instagram</a></li><li><a href="contact">contact</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dsX7eT">Newsletter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/barba.js/1.0.0/barba.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/picturefill/3.0.3/picturefill.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/javascripts/application-3d7742d5.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script>lazyLoad();
