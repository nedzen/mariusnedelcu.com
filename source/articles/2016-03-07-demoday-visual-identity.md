### The Logo
The logo evokes running lanes, crossing pathways and a finish line, which references reaching the end of NUMA Sprint.

### The Poster
To illustrate the festive side of the event, I came up with the theme of ripples in the sky. This complete the general aesthetics of the poster and plays on the idea of making a dent in the universe.
