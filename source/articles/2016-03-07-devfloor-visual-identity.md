### Geometry
The symbol is built inside a square. Horizontally it follows a grid of seven by seven cells. Vertically the dynamic is slightly deviated from the grid, revealing a more natural aesthetic.

### Poster
I also designed a poster

### The Mugs
This logo can look good anywhere so I put it on mugs.
