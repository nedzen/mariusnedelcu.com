intro: Attention is probably the most important function of cognition. Problem solving requires sustained focus on the subject matter in order to understand it in depth and form new ideas. As a designer you know that time to think a problem trough and understand it in it’s entirety will be repayed with a more elegant solution.

Let me show you briefly how I made buttons with inherited properties in Figma. I choose buttons for this example because a simple button is made of only 2 elements:  a rectangle and text.

Let’s begin by making a rectangle and a text in figma. Now make each into a component, bring them together to form a button, select them both and turn it into yet another component, rename them all as follows:

So far you should have 3 components such as:

- `btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn-txt > text`
- `btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`

These are the root components and changing any property that is not subsequently overwritten will propagate to all components containing them.

To keep things simple let's make 2 separate style buttons. Keep in mind that each will have hover and active states which makes 6 buttons in total.

Now, take btn__bg duplicate it 6 times and make each a component again and rename each of it like this:

- `btn.green__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn.green_hover__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn.green_active__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn.yellow__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn.yellow_hover__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`
- `btn.yellow_active__bg > btn__bg > rectangle`

Next, we're gonna create the button text styles just as we did for backgrounds. 2 text styles suffice, so let's make one dark and one white, and rename them as follows:

- `btn-txt__white > btn-txt > text`
- `btn-txt__dark > btn-txt > text`

At this point you maybe ask yourself what are we gonna do with all these components. Let's take `btn` which is our root component and duplicate it 6 times as we did with `btn__bg` making each into a new component and renaming it as follows:

- `btn.green > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`
- `btn.green_hover > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`
- `btn.green_active > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`
- `btn.yellow > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`
- `btn.yellow_hover > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`
- `btn.yellow_active > btn > btn__bg, btn-txt`

So far so good, what we need to do next is to swap the components within `btn`, the second level component, with the ones we have created for background and text style. This results in something like :

- `btn.green > btn > btn.green__bg, btn-txt__dark`
- `btn.green_hover > btn > btn.green_hover__bg, btn-txt__white`
- `btn.greena_active > btn > btn.green_active__bg, btn-txt__white`
- `btn.yellow > btn > btn.yellow__bg, btn-txt__dark`
- `btn.yellow_hover > btn > btn.yellow_hover__bg, btn-txt__white`
- `btn.yellow_active > btn > btn.yellow_active__bg, btn-txt__white`

Ok, I realize this post is starting to look a bit odd but hold tight! Naming is important and we're almost done. In order to have everything work as intended all **constraints on all nested elements should be set to the top & left right & bottom.**
And that's pretty much it. Now when you want to change border radius for all your buttons (regardless of style) you just have to change it once on btn__bg root component. Same for texts.
