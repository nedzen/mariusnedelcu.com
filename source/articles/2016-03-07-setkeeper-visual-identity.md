### Geometry
Simplicity was paramount in exploring the aesthetics of this symbol. Visual clues reference the clapperboard and a diaphragma.

### iOS icon
Because it is used as an iOS icon, a reduced aesthetic reinforces the recognizability of the icon.

### Guidelines
As the logo is used outside the iOS app, I provided clearance guidelines. This assures a correct implementation, as it avoids interfere with other elements.
